```

### Design System

**Color Palette:**
- Selected Seat: Red (#ef4444 → #dc2626)
- Active Row: Blue (#dbeafe background, #3b82f6 accent)
- Reserved: Gray (#9ca3af)
- Available: Light gray (#e5e7eb)

**Animations:**
- Smooth scroll to user's seat (500ms delay)
- Hover scale (1.1x) on seats
- Transition durations: 200-300ms
- Pulse animation on loading skeletons

### Key Features Implemented

1. **Auto-scroll Functionality**
   - Uses `useRef` to reference active seat
   - Smooth scroll with `scrollIntoView`
   - 500ms delay for better UX
   - Centers seat in viewport

2. **Context-Aware Display**
   - Shows ±3 rows around user's seat
   - Reduces information overload
   - Improves mobile performance
   - Shows row range indicator

3. **Reserved Seat Handling**
   - Parses comma-separated string format
   - Skips reserved seats in allocation
   - Visual distinction (grayed out)
   - Disabled interaction

4. **Responsive Design**
   - Mobile-first approach
   - Grid columns adapt: 2 → 3 → 4
   - Touch-friendly targets (≥44x44px)
   - Horizontal scroll for wide rows
   - Readable text sizes

5. **Print Support**
   - Print button with icon
   - Triggers `window.print()`
   - Ready for print CSS (@media print)

    }>;
  }
}
```

## Dependencies

### New Dependencies Required
None! All components use existing dependencies:
- React (already installed)
- Tailwind CSS (already configured)
- Next.js (already installed)
- shadcn/ui components (already available)

### Existing Dependencies Used
- `@/components/ui/card` - Card components
- `@/lib/utils` - `cn()` utility for conditional classes

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Complete Phase 2** - Backend seat allocation API must be implemented
2. **Test with Real Data** - Connect to actual API endpoints
3. **Add Error Boundaries** - Wrap components in error boundaries
4. **Add Print Styles** - Create `@media print` CSS rules

### Phase 4 Integration
Once backend is ready:
1. Test complete flow: enrollment ID → API → seat display
2. Verify reserved seat logic matches backend
3. Test with multiple enclosures and configurations
4. Validate edge cases (no seat, invalid ID, empty enclosure)

### Optional Enhancements
1. Add QR code generation for seat tickets
2. Implement touch gestures (pinch-to-zoom)
3. Add PDF export functionality
4. Show nearby facilities (restrooms, exits)
5. Add 3D venue visualization
6. Implement seat swap requests

---

## Known Limitations

1. **API Dependency**: Components expect specific API response format
2. **Print Styles**: Not yet implemented (ready for CSS)
3. **Browser Support**: Requires modern browser with CSS Grid and Flexbox
4. **Large Enclosures**: Performance not tested with 500+ seats per row
5. **Offline Mode**: No offline/cached seat data support
