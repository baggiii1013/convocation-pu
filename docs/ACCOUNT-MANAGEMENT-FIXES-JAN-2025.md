# Account Management Fixes - January 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Clear Error Messages in Account Creation
**Problem:** Error messages were not showing clear information when account creation failed.

**Solution:** Enhanced error handling in the form submission:
- Added detailed error extraction from API responses
- Created specific error messages based on status codes:
  - **400**: Validation errors
  - **403**: Access denied errors
  - **409**: Duplicate email errors
  - **500**: Server errors
- Added console logging for debugging
- Improved toast notifications with context

**File Modified:** `apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/admin/create-account/page.tsx`

**Example Error Messages:**
- "Validation Error: Password must be at least 8 characters"
- "Email Already Exists: Email already registered"
- "Access Denied: You do not have permission to create accounts"

---

### 2. ✅ Fixed Role Selection - Removed SUPER_ADMIN
**Problem:** The form showed SUPER_ADMIN role, but the system only supports STUDENT, STAFF, and ADMIN.

**Solution:** 
- Updated Zod schema to only allow: `['STUDENT', 'STAFF', 'ADMIN']`
- Updated select dropdown options to match
- Updated role descriptions:
  - **STUDENT**: Can view their own convocation details and profile
  - **STAFF**: Can assist with convocation management and access reports
  - **ADMIN**: Full system access including user management, data upload, and system configuration

**Files Modified:**
- `apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/admin/create-account/page.tsx`
- `apps/api/src/routes/auth.routes.ts` - Updated authorization to only require ADMIN

---

### 3. ✅ Added Navigation Link to Create Account Page
**Problem:** No easy way to navigate to the admin create account page.

**Solution:** Added "Create Account" link to the admin sidebar navigation with a user-plus icon.

**File Modified:** `apps/web/src/components/shared/Sidebar.tsx`

**Navigation Structure:**
```
Admin Section:
├── Admin Dashboard
├── Manage Users
├── Create Account ← NEW!
├── Upload Students
├── Manage Ceremonies
└── Reports
```

**Icon Used:** User with plus sign icon (standard user-add icon)
