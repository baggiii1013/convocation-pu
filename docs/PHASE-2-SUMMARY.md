## 🔧 Technical Features

### Algorithm Highlights

✅ **Smart Seat Assignment**
- Row-by-row allocation following display order
- Respects enclosure entry direction
- Efficient bulk database operations

✅ **Reservation Handling**
- Skips admin-reserved seats from `SeatReservation` table
- Skips row-reserved seats from enclosure configuration
- Prevents double-booking with database constraints

✅ **Enclosure Processing**
- Groups attendees by assigned enclosure
- Processes each enclosure independently
- Handles multiple enclosures concurrently

✅ **Error Management**
- Graceful handling of insufficient seats
- Detailed error reporting for failed allocations
- Transaction-safe database operations

✅ **Performance Optimized**
- O(1) lookups using Set data structures
- Bulk create operations for database efficiency
- Indexed queries for fast retrieval

## 🔄 Workflow

### Typical Usage Flow

1. **Admin Creates Enclosures** (Phase 1)
   - Define rows, seats, and reservations
   - Set entry direction and display order

2. **Admin Reserves Special Seats** (Optional)
   - Reserve VIP seats
   - Reserve accessibility seats
   - Reserve any special-purpose seats

3. **Attendees Are Uploaded**
   - Via Excel upload
   - With `assignedEnclosure` field
   - Mark as eligible and registered

4. **Admin Triggers Allocation**
   ```bash
   POST /api/allocations/allocate-seats
   ```

5. **System Allocates Seats**
   - Reads attendees from database
   - Groups by enclosure
   - Assigns seats skipping reservations
   - Creates allocation records

6. **Students View Their Seats**
   ```bash
   GET /api/allocations/{enrollmentId}
   ```

7. **Admin Monitors Progress**
   ```bash
   GET /api/allocations/stats
   GET /api/allocations/enclosure/{letter}
   ```
