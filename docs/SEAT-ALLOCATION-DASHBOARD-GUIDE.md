# Seat Allocation Dashboard - Complete Guide

**Feature:** Admin Seat Allocation Management  
**Date:** October 6, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED

---

## Overview

The Seat Allocation Dashboard now includes full seat allocation management functionality, allowing administrators to:

1. **Run Seat Allocation** - Automatically assign seats to all unallocated attendees
2. **Clear Allocations** - Remove all seat assignments for re-allocation
3. **View Statistics** - Monitor allocation progress and utilization
4. **Track Results** - See success/failure counts and error details

---

## Features Implemented

### 1. Run Seat Allocation Button

**Purpose:** Automatically assign seats to all eligible attendees

**How it works:**
1. Fetches all attendees with `assignedEnclosure` set and `convocationEligible = true`
2. Groups attendees by enclosure
3. For each enclosure:
   - Loads row configuration
   - Fetches admin-reserved seats
   - Allocates seats sequentially, skipping:
     - Admin-reserved seats
     - Row-level reserved seats
     - Already allocated seats
4. Creates `SeatAllocation` records in database
5. Returns success/failure statistics

**User Experience:**
- Confirmation dialog before execution
- Loading spinner during processing
- Success message with allocation count
- Error message if something fails
- Automatic stats refresh after completion

**API Endpoint:**
```
POST /api/v1/allocations/allocate-seats
Auth: Required (Admin)
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Seat allocation completed: 1150 allocated, 0 failed",
  "data": {
    "allocated": 1150,
    "failed": 0,
    "errors": []
  }
}
```

### 2. Clear All Allocations Button

**Purpose:** Remove all seat assignments to allow re-allocation

**How it works:**
1. Deletes all records from `seat_allocations` table
2. Returns count of cleared allocations
3. Does NOT delete attendees or enclosures

**User Experience:**
- Strong warning dialog ("WARNING: This action cannot be undone")
- Requires double confirmation
- Loading spinner during processing
- Success message with cleared count
- Automatic stats refresh after completion

**API Endpoint:**
```
DELETE /api/v1/allocations/clear
Auth: Required (Admin)
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Cleared 1150 seat allocations",
  "data": {
    "count": 1150
  }
}
```

### 3. Real-time Status Messages

**Success Messages:**
- ✅ "Success! 1150 seats allocated"
- ✅ "Cleared 1150 seat allocations"

**Error Messages:**
- ❌ "Failed to allocate seats: [error details]"
- ❌ "Failed to clear allocations: [error details]"

Messages appear in a prominent banner above action buttons and auto-clear on new actions.

### 4. Allocation Information Box

Provides context about how seat allocation works:
- Attendees must have assigned enclosure
- Sequential seat assignment
- Automatic skipping of reserved seats
- Only processes eligible attendees

```

### Button States

**Run Allocation:**
- Normal: Green background, "Run Seat Allocation"
- Loading: Spinner icon, "Allocating..."
- Disabled: When clearing is in progress

**Clear Allocations:**
- Normal: Red outline, "Clear All Allocations"
- Loading: Spinner icon, "Clearing..."
- Disabled: When allocation is in progress

---

## Usage Workflow

### First-Time Seat Allocation

1. **Upload Attendees** (via Admin > Upload Students)
   - CSV must include `enclosure` column
   - Attendees stored with `assignedEnclosure` field

2. **Configure Enclosures** (via Admin > Enclosures)
   - Create enclosures with rows
   - Set reserved seats if needed

3. **Reserve Admin Seats** (optional, via Admin > Reserve Seats)
   - Manually reserve specific seats
   - System will skip these during allocation

4. **Run Allocation** (Dashboard)
   - Click "Run Seat Allocation"
   - Confirm action
   - Wait for completion (usually 5-30 seconds)
   - Check statistics

5. **Verify Results**
   - Dashboard shows updated allocation count
   - Use Aerial View to inspect seat assignments
   - Check for any failed allocations

### Re-running Allocation

**Scenario:** Need to change seat assignments

1. **Clear Existing Allocations**
   - Click "Clear All Allocations"
   - Confirm warning (double-check!)
   - Wait for completion

2. **Make Changes** (if needed)
   - Modify enclosure configurations
   - Update reserved seats
   - Change attendee enclosure assignments

3. **Run New Allocation**
   - Click "Run Seat Allocation"
   - Confirm action
   - Wait for completion

4. **Verify New Results**
   - Check statistics
   - Review aerial view

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes

**File:** `/apps/web/src/app/admin/dashboard/page.tsx`

**New State Variables:**
```typescript
const [allocating, setAllocating] = useState(false);
const [clearing, setClearing] = useState(false);
const [allocationMessage, setAllocationMessage] = useState<{
  type: 'success' | 'error';
  text: string;
} | null>(null);
```

**New Functions:**
```typescript
handleAllocateSeats() // Triggers seat allocation
handleClearAllocations() // Clears all allocations
```

**New Icons:**
```typescript
Play, Trash2, Loader2 // From lucide-react
```

### Backend Integration

**Allocation Endpoint:**
```typescript
POST /api/v1/allocations/allocate-seats
Controller: AllocationController.allocateSeats()
Service: SeatAllocationService.allocateSeats()
```

**Clear Endpoint:**
```typescript
DELETE /api/v1/allocations/clear
Controller: AllocationController.clearAllocations()
Service: SeatAllocationService.clearAllAllocations()
```

### Error Handling

**Frontend:**
- Try-catch blocks around API calls
- User-friendly error messages
- Console logging for debugging
- Automatic state reset after errors

**Backend:**
- Validation of attendee data
- Transaction safety
- Detailed error responses
- Logging for audit trail

---

## Safety Features

### 1. Confirmation Dialogs

**Allocation:**
```javascript
"Are you sure you want to run seat allocation? 
This will assign seats to all unallocated attendees."
```

**Clear:**
```javascript
"WARNING: This will clear ALL seat allocations! 
This action cannot be undone. Are you sure?"
```

### 2. Mutual Exclusion

- Cannot run allocation while clearing
- Cannot clear while allocating
- Buttons disabled during operations

### 3. Database Constraints

- Unique constraint on seat allocations
- Foreign key relationships
- Cascade deletes for data integrity

### 4. Audit Trail

- Backend logging of all operations
- User tracking (who triggered action)
- Timestamp recording
- Result tracking (success/failure counts)

---

## Performance Considerations

### Allocation Speed

**Factors affecting speed:**
- Number of attendees: ~1000 attendees = 10-20 seconds
- Number of enclosures: More enclosures = slightly faster (parallel processing)
- Database latency: Network speed affects performance
- Reserved seats: More reservations = slightly slower

**Optimization:**
- Batch database operations
- In-memory seat tracking
- Efficient reservation lookup (Set data structure)
- Sequential processing per enclosure

### Frontend Responsiveness

- Non-blocking UI during operations
- Loading indicators prevent user confusion
- Automatic refresh after completion
- Error recovery mechanisms

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No attendees found for allocation"

**Cause:** No attendees meet criteria
- No attendees with `assignedEnclosure` set
- All attendees already allocated
- No attendees with `convocationEligible = true`

**Solution:**
1. Check attendee data in database
2. Ensure CSV upload included enclosure column
3. Verify eligibility flags

### Issue: "Failed to allocate seats"

**Possible Causes:**
- Database connection issues
- Invalid enclosure configurations
- Insufficient available seats
- Reserved seat conflicts

**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for details
2. Verify enclosure configurations
3. Check backend logs
4. Ensure enough seats available

### Issue: Allocation partially succeeds

**Symptoms:** Some attendees allocated, some failed

**Causes:**
- Attendees with invalid enclosure letters
- Enclosures not found in database
- Insufficient seats in some enclosures

**Solution:**
1. Check `data.errors` in response
2. Review failed enclosures
3. Fix issues and re-run

### Issue: Clear operation fails

**Possible Causes:**
- Database permission issues
- Foreign key constraints
- Connection timeout

**Solution:**
1. Check database permissions
2. Ensure proper authentication
3. Try again after brief wait

---

## Best Practices

### Before Running Allocation

✅ **Do:**
- Verify all enclosures are configured
- Check reserved seats are set correctly
- Confirm attendee data is uploaded
- Review statistics to ensure data is ready
- Test with small dataset first (if possible)

❌ **Don't:**
- Run allocation multiple times consecutively
- Run without verifying attendee data
- Skip enclosure configuration
- Ignore unallocated count warnings

### After Running Allocation

✅ **Do:**
- Review allocation statistics
- Check aerial view for spot checks
- Verify utilization rates are reasonable
- Document any issues encountered
- Export allocation data for records

❌ **Don't:**
- Immediately clear and re-run without review
- Modify attendee data without re-allocating
- Change enclosures without clearing first

### Re-allocation Guidelines

**When to re-allocate:**
- Enclosure configuration changed
- Reserved seats modified
- Attendee enclosure assignments changed
- Major errors in initial allocation

**When NOT to re-allocate:**
- Minor seat swap requests (use manual edit)
- Single attendee changes (use manual assignment)
- Cosmetic issues (don't affect functionality)

2. **Average Allocation Time**
   - Target: < 30 seconds for 1000 attendees
   - Monitor for performance degradation

3. **Error Rate**
   - Target: < 1%
   - Track types of errors

4. **Utilization Rate**
   - Target: > 85% per enclosure
   - Indicates efficient seat usage

### Logging

**Backend logs should include:**
- Timestamp
- User who triggered action
- Number of attendees processed
- Number of seats allocated
- Number of failures
- Error details
- Execution time
