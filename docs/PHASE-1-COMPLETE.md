## 📋 Overview

Phase 1 of the Seat Assignment System has been successfully implemented. This phase focused on database schema setup, admin enclosure management, and seat reservation capabilities.

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Database Schema Updates
**Status:** ✅ Complete

#### Changes Made:

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Backend Testing

#### 1. Test Enclosure Creation
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/v1/enclosures \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: accessToken=YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "letter": "A",
    "name": "North Wing",
    "allocatedFor": "STUDENTS",
    "entryDirection": "NORTH",
    "displayOrder": 0,
    "rows": [
      {
        "letter": "A",
        "startSeat": 1,
        "endSeat": 50,
        "reservedSeats": "1,25,50",
        "displayOrder": 0
      },
      {
        "letter": "B",
        "startSeat": 1,
        "endSeat": 50,
        "reservedSeats": "",

2. Implement enclosure-by-enclosure allocation
3. Handle admin-reserved seats (skip during allocation)
4. Handle row-reserved seats (skip during allocation)
5. Create allocation controller
6. Create API endpoints for:
   - Trigger allocation
   - Clear allocations
   - Get attendee seat
7. Update attendee upload to support enclosure column
8. Test allocation with various scenarios

**Estimated Duration:** 5-7 days

## 📝 Notes & Observations

### Design Decisions

1. **Enclosure Letter System**
   - Used single letters (A, B, C) for simplicity
   - Easy to communicate to attendees
   - Simple URL structure

2. **Seat Reservation Model**
   - Separate from SeatAllocation for clarity
   - Allows pre-allocation reservations
   - Admin-controlled with audit fields

3. **Row Configuration**
   - Used comma-separated string for reserved seats
   - Flexible for various patterns
   - Easy to parse and display

4. **Frontend Architecture**
   - Modal forms for better UX
   - Real-time validation
   - Optimistic UI updates

### Challenges Overcome

1. **Prisma Schema Relationships**
   - Fixed enclosure-row relationship
   - Added proper cascade deletes
   - Created correct indexes

2. **UI Component Imports**
   - Fixed casing issues (Button vs button)
   - Created missing components (Label, Select)
   - Ensured TypeScript compatibility

3. **API Route Registration**
   - Properly registered in route index
   - Used correct middleware
   - Fixed authentication imports
